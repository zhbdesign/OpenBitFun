/**
 * SessionDriver — the seam between flow-chat orchestration and a session's
 * transport family.
 *
 * A driver owns everything flavor-specific about a session: how it is
 * created, deleted, renamed, readied, submitted to, and cancelled. Shared
 * choreography (optimistic turns, queues, title generation, store plumbing)
 * stays in flow-chat-manager and calls into the driver at the points where
 * flavors diverge. New chat features land for every flavor by adding one
 * driver member instead of branching in eight files.
 *
 * Naming note: this is deliberately not called "backend" — the codebase uses
 * "backend session" for the Rust-side agent session (`ensureBackendSession`).

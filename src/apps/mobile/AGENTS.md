# AGENTS.md

Native mobile applications are product entrypoints under `src/apps/mobile`.

## Boundaries

- Keep Android, iOS, and HarmonyOS lifecycle and platform API usage inside the
  corresponding platform directory.
- Keep reusable product logic platform-agnostic and expose it through stable
  contracts or adapters.
- Do not import implementation details from `src/apps/desktop` or
  `src/web-ui`.
- Treat remote workspace support as part of feature design. Gate unsupported
  behavior with a clear user-facing state.
- Keep credentials, signing files, provisioning profiles, device identifiers,
  and local SDK paths out of the repository.
- Add platform-specific build and verification commands here when a native
  toolchain is selected.

## Directory Ownership

| Directory | Ownership |
|---|---|
| `android/` | Android app, resources, lifecycle, and adapters |
| `ios/` | iOS app, resources, lifecycle, and adapters |
| `harmonyos/` | HarmonyOS app, resources, lifecycle, and adapters |
| `shared/` | Kotlin Multiplatform core: protocol, crypto, transport, persistence, domain, feature stores |
| `miniapps/` | Build-time packaging and isolated document bridge for product-owned offline tools; native storage and WebView lifecycle stay in each app |
| `design-system/` | HarmonyOS-derived mobile tokens, component contracts, deterministic preview scenarios, and the desktop comparison surface |

## Native UI Contract

HarmonyOS is the visual reference implementation. Stable colors, typography,
geometry, breakpoints, motion durations, component anatomy, and comparison
scenarios are recorded under `design-system/`; Android and iOS consume generated
native constants but continue to render with Compose and SwiftUI respectively.
Do not introduce a shared cross-platform renderer or make generated files the
source of truth.

- Change the HarmonyOS implementation and the source contract together when a
  stable visual fact changes.
- Run `pnpm run mobile:ui:generate` after contract changes and commit the
  generated native files.
- Run `pnpm run mobile:ui:check` before pushing to reject generated drift.
- Use `pnpm run mobile:ui:preview` for the local three-column HarmonyOS / Android
  / iOS comparison surface. Native captures belong under the documented
  `design-system/preview/snapshots/` convention and are local evidence unless a
  fixture is intentionally reviewed into the repository.
- Keep safe areas, keyboard behavior, accessibility, navigation gestures, and
  platform presentation primitives in each native app.

## Shared Core

`shared/` holds the Kotlin Multiplatform modules that `android/` and `ios/`
build on. `core-feature` is the platform seam: everything the apps see is a
UiState or an Intent declared there, and no module above it is visible to them.

- `android/` and `ios/` may depend on `shared/`. `shared/` must not depend on
  any platform directory, and `harmonyos/` and `shared/` do not depend on each
  other.
- `android/` is its own build root and pulls `shared/` in with
  `includeBuild("../shared")`, so the arrow points one way only: the app knows
  the shared build, never the reverse. That makes app dependencies read as
  coordinates — `implementation("com.openbitfun.mobile:core-feature")` — rather than
  `project(":core-feature")`. Both spellings are subject to the seam rule below.
- `core-feature` is the only shared module the apps may reference. Everything
  crossing that seam is a UiState or an Intent, never a repository or a DTO.
- `core-domain` is pure logic. Transport and persistence are adapters behind
  ports it declares, wired by `core-feature`.
- Shared code returns typed states, never localized display strings; the apps
  own all user-facing text.
- Remote session content is read on demand from the online desktop
  (`core-transport/.../HostStream.kt`, `read_stream` device RPC plus encrypted
  `host-stream-changed` hints). The relay stores none of it and the apps keep
  no relay stream replica: a `STREAM_EVENT_GAP` means the desktop restarted the
  stream and derived state must be dropped, and a host without `host_stream_v1`
  is surfaced as `RemoteSessionFailureReason.HOST_STREAM_UNSUPPORTED`, never
  probed with unknown commands. Do not reintroduce `relay_stream_*` tables.
- Run `pnpm run mobile:architecture` before pushing. It enforces the rules
  above, mirroring `pnpm run harmony:architecture`.
- Build and test from `shared/`: `./gradlew jvmTest` for host logic,
  `./gradlew assembleAndroidMain testAndroidHostTest` for Android, and
  `./gradlew compileKotlinIosSimulatorArm64` for iOS. Run iOS pure Swift
  infrastructure checks from the repository root with
  `(cd src/apps/mobile/ios && ./Testing/run-pure-swift-tests.sh)`.
  The isolated native streaming fixture (no remote requests) is covered by
  `xcodebuild -project src/apps/mobile/ios/OpenBitFun.xcodeproj -scheme OpenBitFun -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Plus' -parallel-testing-enabled NO -only-testing:OpenBitFunUITests/StreamingPresentationUITests test`.
  Run it on one phone and one iPad destination when changing timeline layout,
  streaming reveal, keyboard dismissal, or history anchoring. The Debug-only
  launch argument `--streaming-regression` opens the same deterministic fixture.
  `local.properties` holds
  the local SDK path and is not committed.
- The Android app builds from `android/`: `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug` and
  `:app:installDebug`; release verification is `./gradlew :app:assembleRelease`.
  Release builds use the standard local Android debug keystore when formal
  signing credentials are absent; all four `OPENBITFUN_ANDROID_KEYSTORE`,
  `OPENBITFUN_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `OPENBITFUN_ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`, and
  `OPENBITFUN_ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD` environment variables override it. Signing
  files and values must never be committed. AGP 9 compiles Kotlin itself — applying
  `org.jetbrains.kotlin.android` is an error, not a no-op, and
  `kotlin { jvmToolchain(...) }` is no longer available in an app module.
- Crypto and transport also run on a device: `./gradlew
  :core-crypto:connectedAndroidDeviceTest :core-transport:connectedAndroidDeviceTest`
  from `shared/`, with an emulator or handset attached. Those suites compile the
  same `commonTest` sources onto ART; they are not in CI, so run them by hand
  when touching either module.

## Remote capability ownership

Native mobile surfaces are controllers. Desktop and CLI own execution, files, terminals and SSH credentials. Mobile workspace selection may use only connections already saved on the controlled runtime; it must not create an SSH connection or instantiate another runtime. Carry the selected connection identity through every operation, and report missing identity instead of falling back to local files.

## Offline Mini Apps

Android preBuild and the iOS resource phase run `miniapps/generate.cjs` (Node.js
must be on PATH). Generated native HTML is ignored; update product-owned built-in
sources or the packaging owner, never the generated resources. Harmony retains
its existing native host and invokes the same generator without native wrappers.
Run `node --test src/apps/mobile/miniapps/*.test.cjs src/apps/mobile/harmonyos/miniapps/*.test.cjs`
from the repository root after bundle/bridge changes. Storage keys remain scoped
to an allowlisted app; retain unreadable records and surface the error.

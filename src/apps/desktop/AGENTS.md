# AGENTS.md

## Scope

This file applies to `src/apps/desktop`. Use the top-level `AGENTS.md` for repository-wide rules.

## What matters here

`src/apps/desktop` is the Tauri host / integration layer.

Main areas:

- `src/api/`: Tauri commands
- `src/api/peer_host_invoke.rs`: Peer Device Mode host-invoke bridge + control attach;
  allow/deny and capabilities come from the Product Operation Registry
  (`openbitfun_product_domains::remote_surface`), not from a local table
- `src/api/remote_workspace_policy.rs`: closure test proving every registered Tauri
  command has one registry row
- `src/lib.rs`, `src/main.rs`: app setup and wiring
- `src/computer_use/`: OS-specific automation support

Peer Device Mode ownership and boundaries:
`docs/architecture/peer-device-mode.md`.
Frontend regression guards:
`src/web-ui/src/infrastructure/peer-device/README.md`.

GitHub identity is shared through `account_identity_api.rs`. Relay device
registration and lifecycle live in `src/api/remote_connect_api.rs`; settings
remain on their owning device and there is no cloud/local sync choice.

The Relay deployment wizard is retired. Preserve the developer scripts under
`src/apps/relay-server` and their [operator guide](../relay-server/README.md).
The retained Tauri wrapper and services orchestration are compatibility tools,
not an entry point to restore in the product UI.

If a change affects behavior shared by multiple runtimes, place stable contracts,
execution policy, and services in their owning lower-layer crates. Keep only
product wiring and compatibility bridges in `src/crates/assembly/core`.

## Local rules

- Keep desktop-only integrations here; do not move them into shared core
- Window lifecycle behavior, including close/minimize-to-tray defaults, is a
  desktop surface concern. Preserve saved user preferences when changing it.
- `window_state_support` owns main-window geometry validation and atomic
  persistence in the legacy `.window-state.json` format. Do not reinstall the
  window-state plugin alongside it: the plugin's exit cache can overwrite repairs.

## Commands

Use these for the desktop development loop. Verification commands are kept in
the Verification section below.

```bash
pnpm run desktop:dev
pnpm run desktop:preview:debug
pnpm run prepare:dsh-profile   # optional: local DeepSeek Harness sessions
```

Data Migrator runs independently. Desktop development launchers do not build,
launch, or supervise the migrator; use its own development and release entry
points under `src/apps/data-migrator`.

## Fast builds

| Command | When to use |
|---|---|
| `pnpm run desktop:build:fast` | Debug build without bundling; fastest compile for manual testing |
| `pnpm run desktop:build:release-fast` | Release-like no-bundle build with reduced LTO; run it in place and never distribute the raw executable alone |
| `pnpm run desktop:build:nsis:fast` | Windows installer using `release-fast` profile; for quick installer validation |

Set `CARGO_PROFILE_DEV_DEBUG=2` when full breakpoint debug information is
required. The default dev profile keeps line tables while reducing PDB size.

## Target cache GC

`desktop:dev` (on exit), `desktop:preview:debug` (on shutdown), and `desktop:build*` prune stale `target/<profile>` cache generations. Incremental roots keep the latest crate/session. Cargo fingerprint JSON identifies distinct lib, test, bin, and build-script units; GC keeps the latest generation of each unit plus every generation whose Cargo-managed `invoked.timestamp` was refreshed within the last 24 hours, then removes orphaned `deps` files and `build` directories. Busy detection is scoped to Cargo lock files in the selected profile, so an unrelated worktree build does not suppress GC. Manual: `pnpm run target:gc -- --profile debug`. Disable with `OPENBITFUN_TARGET_GC=0`; dry-run with `OPENBITFUN_TARGET_GC_DRY_RUN=1`; adjust the grace window with `OPENBITFUN_TARGET_GC_MIN_AGE_HOURS`.

`release-fast` profile (`Cargo.toml`): inherits `release` but disables LTO, increases `codegen-units` to 16, enables incremental compilation. Significantly faster at the cost of binary size and marginal runtime performance.

All commands that pass `--no-bundle` emit a staged runtime tree rather than a
single-file application. The executable depends on the adjacent `frontend`,
`flashgrep`, `mobile-web`, and `resources` directories. Use
`pnpm run desktop:build:nsis` for a distributable Windows installer.

## DevTools feature (model rule)

The `devtools` Cargo feature exists for debugging UI/UX in the desktop app. When adding or modifying debug-related code:

- Guard all debug-only APIs and commands with `#[cfg(any(debug_assertions, feature = "devtools"))]`
- Provide no-op stubs under `#[cfg(not(any(debug_assertions, feature = "devtools")))]` so commands can always be registered in `invoke_handler`
- The feature is enabled automatically in `dev` builds and `release-fast` profile builds via `--features devtools`
- Never enable in `release` profile builds intended for end users

## Verification

For macOS microphone signing metadata, run
`plutil -lint src/apps/desktop/Info.plist src/apps/desktop/Entitlements.plist`
and `node --test scripts/ci/verify-macos-microphone.test.mjs` on macOS.
For metadata-only changes, these focused checks replace the Rust build/test commands below.
Before distributing, run `bash scripts/ci/verify-macos-microphone.sh <signed-app-bundle>`
(also required by the release signing verification), then verify microphone consent
and recording in the signed app on macOS. Ad-hoc fixture tests do not prove TCC behavior.

```bash
cargo check -p openbitfun-desktop && cargo test -p openbitfun-desktop
```

For session storage directory access, run
`cargo test -p openbitfun-desktop --lib api::session_storage_directory::tests`
for session storage directory resolution (these tests do not launch a file manager),
and `cargo test -p openbitfun-desktop --lib remote_workspace_policy` after registration changes.

For MiniApp Agent session and context changes, run
`cargo test --locked -p openbitfun-desktop --lib api::miniapp_agent_api::tests`.
This covers legacy payloads, exact context paths, trust instructions, and snapshot cleanup.

For tray unread synchronization, run
`pnpm --dir src/web-ui run test:run src/flow_chat/services/trayUnreadService.test.ts src/flow_chat/services/sessionNavStatusService.test.ts`
and `cargo test -p openbitfun-desktop --lib remote_workspace_policy` after command changes.

For shared GitHub sign-in and token redaction, use
`cargo test -p openbitfun-desktop --lib api::account_identity_api::tests`.
For the matching cross-entry UI state, run
`pnpm --dir src/web-ui run test:run src/infrastructure/account-identity/AccountIdentityService.test.ts src/features/market-account/AccountIdentityControls.test.tsx src/app/components/RemoteConnectDialog/ensureAccountSession.test.ts`.

For side-question request compatibility, initial model selection, and optional
message metadata, use
`cargo test -p openbitfun-desktop --no-default-features --lib api::btw_api::tests`.

For snapshot workspace identity and remote rollback admission, use
`cargo test --locked -p openbitfun-desktop --lib api::snapshot_service::tests` and
`pnpm --dir src/web-ui run test:run src/infrastructure/api/service-api/SnapshotAPI.test.ts`.

For skill discovery response compatibility and timeouts, use
`cargo test -p openbitfun-desktop --lib api::skill_api::tests`.
For companion pet manifest versions and package metadata, use
`cargo test -p openbitfun-desktop --lib api::commands::pet_package_tests`.
For content-search routing and remote fallback protection, use
`cargo test --locked -p openbitfun-desktop --lib api::search_api::tests`.
For controller-local peer download staging, atomic replacement, and failed transfer cleanup,
run `cargo test -p openbitfun-desktop --lib api::local_file_download::tests`.
After changing its registration, also run
`cargo test -p openbitfun-desktop --lib remote_workspace_policy`.

For Windows external-file drag previews, run
`cargo test --locked -p openbitfun-desktop --lib file_drop_preview_api` and
`pnpm --dir src/web-ui run test:run src/infrastructure/files/useWindowsFileDropPreview.test.tsx src/app/scenes/session/FileDropPreviewCards.test.tsx`.
After rebuilding Desktop, manually check Explorer drags with one image, more than
four images, mixed file formats, Escape, leaving the pane, and a scene switch.
Verify HTML text/tab/file-tree drags still work. The temporary OLE child only
covers the active chat target during an external file drag; do not enable Wry's
window-wide Windows handler as a replacement. After command registration changes,
also run `cargo test -p openbitfun-desktop --lib remote_workspace_policy`.

The layered receiver requires the compatibility declaration in
`windows-app.manifest`; keep it wired through `build.rs` for dev and release.
After changes to that contract, run
`node --test scripts/desktop-tauri-build.test.mjs` and `cargo build -p openbitfun-desktop`.
The focused native test creates and destroys 50 real, hidden receiver windows.
The Shell regression also uses a real `IDataObject` and drag-image helpers to
verify 20 takeovers leave no `SysDragImage`, and that the next target can restore
the source image and clean it up on drop/cancel. `IDropTargetHelper::Show(false)`
alone does not dismiss the modern layered image; end the Shell renderer session
before displaying the custom preview, while keeping the OLE receiver active.
If the Windows Tauri library test loader fails before running tests, embed the
same desktop manifest into a temporary copy of the generated test executable
using the Windows SDK `mt.exe`, then run the `file_drop_preview_api` filter on
that copy. A Common Controls-only manifest cannot exercise layered children.

For staged application-update cache and signature behavior, use
`cargo test -p openbitfun-desktop --lib api::update_api::tests`.
For peer system-info response compatibility, run
`cargo test -p openbitfun-desktop --lib system_info_home_contract`.
For window geometry recovery, legacy state compatibility, and snapshot persistence,
run `cargo test -p openbitfun-desktop --lib window_state_support::tests`.
For Windows main-WebView minimize/restore size filtering, run
`cargo test -p openbitfun-desktop --no-default-features --lib window_webview_geometry::tests`.
The desktop host owns main-WebView resizing on Windows so minimized client bounds
do not trigger page reflow; embedded browser WebViews keep their existing owners.
After rebuilding, manually compare taskbar minimize/restore with tray hide/show
while a session is open, and check normal resize, maximize, and monitor DPI changes.
For the matching startup wiring contract, run
`pnpm --dir src/web-ui run test:run src/app/startup/startupPerformanceContract.test.ts`.
For native sidebar material and appearance bootstrap, run
`cargo test -p openbitfun-desktop --no-default-features --lib appearance::startup_appearance_tests`
and `pnpm --dir src/web-ui run test:run src/infrastructure/appearance/adapters/ThemeTokenAppearanceAdapter.test.ts`.
For embedded browser preview encoding and target correlation, run
`cargo test -p openbitfun-desktop --lib api::browser_api::tests`.
After browser command registration changes, also run
`cargo test -p openbitfun-desktop --lib remote_workspace_policy`.
After changing updater command registration, also run
`cargo test -p openbitfun-desktop --lib remote_workspace_policy`.

If the change affects startup, WebDriver, browser/computer-use, or packaged behavior, also run:

```bash
cargo build -p openbitfun-desktop
```

To exercise packaged UI customization in an isolated native window without a
development server, build Web UI assets, then use the focused Creation harness:

```bash
pnpm run build:web
cargo build -p openbitfun-desktop --features devtools
node tests/e2e/scripts/run-creation-runtime.mjs
node tests/e2e/scripts/run-creation-runtime.mjs --suspended-paint  # occluded WebKit startup and reload
```

The harness copies a completed build into an independent frontend snapshot so
concurrent builds cannot replace its lazy modules. It uses temporary product storage, a private WebView store, and
`OPENBITFUN_E2E_PACKAGED_FRONTEND=1`. It checks state across document reloads;
the private test store intentionally does not survive process exit.
That debug-only switch takes effect only with the existing E2E storage guard;
release builds always use the packaged protocol.

For alternate dev-server ports and preview startup URL changes, run
`node --test scripts/dev-startup.test.mjs` and
`cargo test -p openbitfun-desktop --no-default-features --lib appearance::development_frontend_tests`.
`OPENBITFUN_DEV_PORT` selects the HTTP port; `OPENBITFUN_DEV_HMR_PORT` defaults
to the previous port. Desktop and Vite must use the same values. Development
launchers reuse the locked Sherpa library/archive cache across Git worktrees,
or download the archive through curl when absent; explicit SHERPA_ONNX overrides win.

For the real macOS ComputerUse tool observation/input roundtrip, run
`node scripts/test-macos-control-roundtrip.mjs`. This launches a disposable
AppKit target and the `computer_use_native_roundtrip` test with `devtools`.
The harness has its own main-thread CFRunLoop and exercises the production
main-queue dispatcher; do not run this test through libtest or bypass that
dispatcher. It requires local Accessibility and Screen Recording permission.
To reuse the compiled harness, set `OPENBITFUN_TEST_BINARY` to its absolute path.
